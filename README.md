# MicroFlex-Architecture
**MicroFlex Architecture** is a comprehensive project designed to showcase the deployment and management of a microservices-based application using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. The project aims to demonstrate best practices in creating, scaling, and managing containerized microservices efficiently.

#### Project Overview:

**MicroFlex Architecture** provides a hands-on approach to understanding how to leverage Docker and Kubernetes in a real-world application scenario. The project focuses on setting up a multi-service application environment, where each microservice performs a distinct role within the application ecosystem.

#### Key Features:

- **Containerization with Docker:** Each microservice of the application is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency, and portability across different environments.
- **Orchestration with Kubernetes:** Kubernetes is used to orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and management of the containerized services, demonstrating how to handle microservices at scale.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Utilizes Kubernetes' built-in service discovery and load balancing to facilitate communication and resource allocation among the microservices.
- **Auto-scaling:** Implements auto-scaling features of Kubernetes to automatically scale the services based on the load.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrates monitoring and logging tools to keep track of the health and performance of the microservices and the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Technical Components:

- **Front-end Service:** A lightweight front-end service providing the user interface, possibly developed in React or Angular.
- **Back-end Services:** Multiple back-end services handling business logic, developed in languages such as Node.js, Python, or Go.
- **Database Services:** Relational or NoSQL database services like PostgreSQL or MongoDB to persist application data.
- **Authentication Service:** A service dedicated to user authentication and authorization.

=== **STEP BY STEP PRACTICAL WALKTHROUGH OF THE PROJECT BELOW** ===


### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster
- kubectl configured

### Deployment

1. **Build Docker Images**
   Navigate to each service directory and build Docker images.
   ```bash
   docker build -t microflex/frontend ./services/frontend
   docker build -t microflex/backend ./services/backend
   ```
2. **Deploy to Kubernetes**
Use the YAML files in the kubernetes/ directory to deploy your services.
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/frontend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/backend-deployment.yaml
```
3. Scaling Services
Kubernetes allows for easy scaling of services. To scale your backend service, use:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment backend --replicas=3
```
**Monitoring and Logging**
Setup Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and ELK Stack for logging. Configuration files are provided in the monitoring/ directory.

To complete the "MicroFlex Architecture" project as outlined, follow these detailed steps and content guidelines for each component:

1. **Project Structure Setup**
First, create the necessary directories to organize your project:

```bash
mkdir -p microflex/{services/frontend,services/backend,kubernetes,scripts,monitoring}
touch microflex/services/frontend/Dockerfile
touch microflex/services/backend/Dockerfile
touch microflex/kubernetes/frontend-deployment.yaml
touch microflex/kubernetes/backend-deployment.yaml
touch microflex/monitoring/prometheus.yaml
touch microflex/monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json
```

2. Dockerfiles for Microservices
Frontend Dockerfile (microflex/services/frontend/Dockerfile)
dockerfile
```bash
# Use a node base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

# Expose port and start application
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
Backend Dockerfile (microflex/services/backend/Dockerfile)
dockerfile
Copy code
# Use a Python base image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the dependencies file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

# Expose port and start application
EXPOSE 5000
CMD [ "python", "./app.py" ]
```

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['backend-service:5000']

  - job_name: 'microflex-frontend'
    static_configs:

```
Grafana Dashboard Configuration for Visualizing Metrics
Location: microflex/monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json

Since the Grafana dashboard configuration is a JSON model exported from the Grafana UI, it's recommended to design your dashboard directly in Grafana, tailored to the specific metrics you're monitoring with Prometheus, and then export the configuration. Here's a simple example of what the content might look like:

**Example Grafana Dashboard Configuration (microflex/monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json)**
```json

This JSON is just a basic template. Your actual dashboard should be designed according to the specific metrics you're monitoring, and then you can export the JSON model from the Grafana UI.
