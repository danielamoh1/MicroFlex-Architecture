# MicroFlex-Architecture
**MicroFlex Architecture** is a comprehensive project designed to showcase the deployment and management of a microservices-based application using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. The project aims to demonstrate best practices in creating, scaling, and managing containerized microservices efficiently.

#### Project Overview:

**MicroFlex Architecture** provides a hands-on approach to understanding how to leverage Docker and Kubernetes in a real-world application scenario. The project focuses on setting up a multi-service application environment, where each microservice performs a distinct role within the application ecosystem.

#### Key Features:

- **Containerization with Docker:** Each microservice of the application is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency, and portability across different environments.
- **Orchestration with Kubernetes:** Kubernetes is used to orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and management of the containerized services, demonstrating how to handle microservices at scale.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Utilizes Kubernetes' built-in service discovery and load balancing to facilitate communication and resource allocation among the microservices.
- **Auto-scaling:** Implements auto-scaling features of Kubernetes to automatically scale the services based on the load.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrates monitoring and logging tools to keep track of the health and performance of the microservices and the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Technical Components:

- **Front-end Service:** A lightweight front-end service providing the user interface, possibly developed in React or Angular.
- **Back-end Services:** Multiple back-end services handling business logic, developed in languages such as Node.js, Python, or Go.
- **Database Services:** Relational or NoSQL database services like PostgreSQL or MongoDB to persist application data.
- **Authentication Service:** A service dedicated to user authentication and authorization.

=== **STEP BY STEP PRACTICAL WALKTHROUGH OF THE PROJECT BELOW** ===


### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster
- kubectl configured

### **INSTALLING KUBERNETES AND DOCKER ON CentOS**
Installing Kubernetes on a CentOS Linux system involves several key steps, from setting up the Docker container engine to installing Kubernetes itself. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to achieve this:

### Step 1: Update Your System
First, ensure your system packages are up-to-date. This step enhances security and performance.

```markdown
sudo yum update -y
```

### Step 2: Disable SELinux
SELinux might interfere with Kubernetes components. Temporarily disabling it ensures smoother installation and operation.

```markdown
sudo setenforce 0
sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=enforcing$/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config
```

### Step 3: Install Docker
Kubernetes requires a container runtime, and Docker is a popular choice. Install Docker to manage the containers.

```markdown
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

### Step 4: Start and Enable Docker
Ensure Docker starts at boot and is currently running.

```markdown
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Step 5: Configure Kubernetes Repository
Kubernetes packages are not available in the default CentOS repositories. Add the Kubernetes repository manually.

```markdown
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
[kubernetes]
name=Kubernetes
baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-\$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg
EOF
```

### Step 6: Install Kubernetes
Now, you can install Kubernetes components: `kubelet`, `kubeadm`, and `kubectl`.

```markdown
sudo yum install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl --disableexcludes=kubernetes
```

### Step 7: Start and Enable kubelet
The `kubelet` service needs to be started and enabled to run on boot.

```markdown
sudo systemctl start kubelet
sudo systemctl enable kubelet
```

### Step 8: Disable Swap
Kubernetes doesn't work with swap memory enabled. Disable it to avoid issues.

```markdown
sudo swapoff -a
sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^/#/' /etc/fstab
```

### Step 9: Initialize Kubernetes Cluster
Use `kubeadm` to initialize your Kubernetes cluster. Adjust `--pod-network-cidr` based on the network plugin you plan to use.

```markdown
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

### Step 10: Configure kubectl
After initializing the cluster, set up the local kubeconfig to use `kubectl` for cluster management.

```markdown
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

### Step 11: Deploy a Pod Network
Kubernetes requires a pod network for containers to communicate. Flannel is a simple choice.

```markdown
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

### Final Steps and Verification
After completing the installation, verify the cluster status.

```markdown
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see your node listed as "Ready," indicating a successful Kubernetes installation on your CentOS system. This guide provides a straightforward approach to setting up Kubernetes, but always refer to the official Kubernetes documentation for the most up-to-date practices and troubleshooting tips.

### Deployment

1. **Build Docker Images**
   Navigate to each service directory and build Docker images.
   ```bash
   docker build -t microflex/frontend ./services/frontend
   docker build -t microflex/backend ./services/backend
   ```
2. **Deploy to Kubernetes**
Use the YAML files in the kubernetes/ directory to deploy your services.
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/frontend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/backend-deployment.yaml
```
3. Scaling Services
Kubernetes allows for easy scaling of services. To scale your backend service, use:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment backend --replicas=3
```
**Monitoring and Logging**
Setup Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and ELK Stack for logging. Configuration files are provided in the monitoring/ directory.
